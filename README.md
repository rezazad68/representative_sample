# Polydisperse Nano-objects Representative sample selection software
Our study introduces a pioneering algorithm that harnesses the density distribution of individual microgels to construct a clustering space, aimed at identifying the most representative samples. By leveraging the density distribution, we gain deeper insights into the microgel structure, facilitating more effective grouping. Within each cluster, we identify the top N samples that best represent the group, while filtering out any noisy samples. This method streamlines microgel analysis and enhances our capacity to extract valuable insights from intricate datasets. Our software can be utilized across a range of Polydisperse Nano-Objects to isolate representative samples, while simultaneously documenting the process step by step.
